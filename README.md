Study Plan Generator
Overview
The Study Plan Generator is a web-based application designed to help learners generate personalized study roadmaps for various domains like Web Development, Data Science, AI, and more. By simply entering a domain, users can access a detailed, step-by-step guide to learn the necessary skills, technologies, and topics required to become proficient in that field. The tool leverages the power of the Cohere AI API to generate detailed roadmaps that include core learning milestones, project suggestions, and advanced topics for specialization.

Key Features
AI-Powered Roadmap Generation: Generate a comprehensive learning path for a wide range of domains using Cohere AI.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly, dynamic interface built with Streamlit that allows easy navigation and input.
Glassmorphism Design: Modern and visually appealing UI that offers a smooth user experience.
Study Flashcards: Flashcard game integration based on the roadmap content to help reinforce learning.
Multi-Page Navigation: Seamless navigation between multiple pages, including Home, Roadmap, About Us, and Flashcards.
Fully Customizable: Users can enter any domain they want, and the tool will generate a tailored study plan for them.
