# Study Plan Generator

## Overview
The **Study Plan Generator** is an AI-powered web application that helps learners generate personalized study roadmaps for various domains. By inputting a specific domain like Web Development, Data Science, AI, etc., users receive a detailed, step-by-step guide to mastering the necessary skills and technologies. The roadmap includes milestones, project ideas, and advanced topics, ensuring a structured approach to learning.

This project leverages **Cohere AI** for generating detailed study plans and **Streamlit** for building the interactive web interface with a smooth, modern user experience.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Roadmap Generation**: Generate personalized study plans for domains like Web Development, Data Science, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface with seamless navigation and user input via **Streamlit**.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern and visually pleasing UI design for an immersive learning experience.
- **Study Flashcards**: Game-like flashcards to reinforce the learning content.
- **Multi-Page Navigation**: Navigation between the home page, roadmap generation, about us, and flashcard game pages.
- **Customizable**: Enter any domain and get a tailored study roadmap.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: To build the interactive web application and handle user input and display.
- **Cohere API**: To generate the personalized AI-powered study plans based on user input.
- **Python**: For the backend logic and API integration.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For custom UI elements, especially for the glassmorphism design.
